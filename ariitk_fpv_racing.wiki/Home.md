## Installation

Create a catkin workspace in home dir (ignore if already done)
```
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin init
```
Clone the repositiory into the src folder
```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/ariitk_fpv_racing
```
Build using ``` catkin build ``` after making sure all the dependencies are met.

### Paramters

1. **detector_ros** :
```
    -> h_min, s_min, v_min : min values for hsv
    -> h_max, s_max, v_max : max values for hsv
    -> canny_ker, canny_lower, canny_upper : canny params
    -> min_contour_area : setting the area for the detection algorithm
```

2. **planner** :
```
    -> frame1, frame2, frame3, frame4 : rough poses for the frames
    -> thresh_dist : a thresholded distance used in motion planning
```
---

**Method and Algorithm** :
```
    ->Detection of frame based on colour. ApproxPolyDP is used and if it returns 4 points, then we can assertain an quadrilateral (and hence the frame). Further filtering based on contour area to remove noise and faraway frames.
    
    ->Distance estimation using similarity of triangles. The distance obtained is the scale factor while going from camera coordinates to world coordinates.
    
    ->While the drone is operational, once it passes through one frame, it uses the rough position of the next frame (given manually) to change its yaw.
